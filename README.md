# Perfect-Websockets
This is my attempt at:
- Following Jeffrey's Tutorial found at : https://jeffreyfulton.ca/blog/2017/07/getting-started-with-perfect
- Adding Perfect Websockets into the project


Currently: 
  The project compiles and runs, but it appears that I can't read the message from the client on the server.
  Further Debugging is required.
